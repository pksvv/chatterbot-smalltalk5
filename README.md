### A chatbot pilot leveraging chatterbot and flask

*ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a userâ€™s input.*

*It uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses.*

*This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users. It uses a number of machine learning algorithms to produce a variety of responses. It becomes easier for the users to make chatbots using the ChatterBot library with more accurate responses.*

*However, the context retention, next step prediction features will need to be developed. This library is a good choice for a small quick implementation.*
